# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **The app opens your browser:** `pnpm walkdiff app` now opens the review list. Use `--no-open` to turn this off.
- **Coverage for each PR, with no setup:** Walkdiff now looks for a report in CI artifacts of the PR's latest commit and in files the PR adds to a folder, in the app too. Or choose **Attach coverage** on a review: the report updates at once, with no restart.
- **oxlint and jscpd now install with Walkdiff,** so they work with no extra setup, including in CI, at versions pinned in the lockfile. Earlier global installs are no longer used.
- **Post your review:** in the app, post comments and Comment, Approve or Request changes from the finish screen, to GitHub or GitLab. Nothing is posted until you press the button, and Walkdiff refuses if the PR has new commits since the report was made.
- **Conversation:** the app shows existing threads in a new tab and beside each change, where you can reply and resolve them, plus who has reviewed so far.
- **Fewer false warnings:** reports no longer list "Change history" under checks that didn't run on every PR. It was never built, so it wasn't a gap you could do anything about. It's still planned.
- **Syntax highlighting:** code in the report is now coloured for Rust, TypeScript, JavaScript and Python, in light and dark mode, alongside the added and removed colours and edited-word marks. Other files stay plain, and so do very long lines and very large files, to keep the page fast.
- **Breaking changes:** Walkdiff flags public APIs, database migrations, environment variables and config keys that could break other code or a deployment. Each one is a stop on the review path that says what could break and which callers are affected. These findings never change the security level. See [Breaking changes](README.md#breaking-changes). The review model schema is now version 11.
- **Settings page:** the app now has a page to turn optional checks on or off, choose the AI provider and model, test the connection, and see what leaves your machine.
- **More AI providers:** besides Anthropic, Walkdiff can use any OpenAI-compatible service or a local model such as Ollama, with `--ai-provider openai-compatible --ai-base-url <address> --ai-model <name>`. Keys come from `WALKDIFF_AI_API_KEY`, and only https addresses are accepted unless the model is on your machine.
- **Team limits on AI:** `"ai": { "providers": ["local"] }` in `.walkdiff.json` limits where a repository's code can be sent.
- **Changes since your last review:** progress and comments now belong to the PR, not the commit. After a new push, ticks stay on what didn't change, and anything you reviewed that did change comes first, showing the difference from the version you saw. Progress saved by earlier versions isn't carried over.
- **Test evidence:** `--coverage` reads an LCOV or Cobertura report and shows whether each change's lines ran in tests. Changes whose lines didn't run rank higher. Also available as the Action's `coverage-file` input and the GitLab template's `WALKDIFF_COVERAGE` variable. The review model schema is now version 10.

## 0.2.0

- **Renamed to Walkdiff.** The command is now `pnpm walkdiff`, the config file is `.walkdiff.json`, and the trusted hosts variables are `WALKDIFF_TRUSTED_GITHUB_HOSTS` and `WALKDIFF_TRUSTED_GITLAB_HOSTS`. An existing `.lens.json` keeps working, but the old variables don't, so set the new ones or tokens won't be sent to those hosts. Saved reviews aren't moved, so the app starts with an empty list.
- **Code quality:** Walkdiff flags complexity, long functions and lint problems in the code a PR adds, using built-in measures and optional Ruff, oxlint and jscpd. Findings appear as reasons on the review path and never change the security level.

## 0.1.0

The first release, published under the name Lens. Walkdiff is early software, so expect changes, and it hasn't had an independent security audit.

### The review

- **Guided review:** the report opens on a brief with what to check and where to start, then takes you through the changes that matter most, explaining why each one is there.
- **Progress and comments:** mark changes as reviewed and leave comments, on the path or in All changes. Both are saved in your browser, by commit. Comments can be copied for the PR, but aren't posted to it yet.
- **Whole functions:** each changed function or type appears whole, before and after, for Rust, TypeScript, JavaScript and Python. Other languages get a line diff.
- **Impact:** where the rest of the code uses what changed, and which callers the PR didn't touch.
- **Risks:** a security level, built-in rules for secrets, risky APIs and sensitive areas, and known vulnerabilities through OSV.
- **Security scanners:** optional Semgrep, gitleaks and osv-scanner.
- **AI review:** optional reading order, description check and questions. Nothing is sent without `--ai`.

### Using it

- `walkdiff review` for a single report, and `walkdiff app` to keep track of several reviews.
- A GitHub Action and a GitLab CI template that add a report and a summary comment to each PR.
- Team rules in `.walkdiff.json`, read from the merge base so a PR can't change its own rules.

### Security

- Tokens go only to github.com, gitlab.com and hosts you trust.
- Pull request code is never built or run.
- See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the guarantees and their limits.

### Known limits

- Not yet tried against a real GitLab merge request, GitHub Enterprise, self-managed GitLab or a live AI review.
- The review path's ranking uses simple rules, and hasn't been tested with reviewers yet. It can rank an important change too low, so use All changes when in doubt.
- Progress doesn't carry over to a new push.
