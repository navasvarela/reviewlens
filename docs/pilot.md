# Running a pilot

The goal is to learn whether reviewers choose to use the report, and whether reviews get faster without letting more bugs through. Run it with 8 to 10 volunteers on real PRs for two weeks, and take baselines from the four weeks before.

## Setup

### GitHub

Add `.github/workflows/reviewlens.yml`:

```yaml
name: ReviewLens
on: pull_request
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
jobs:
  report:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    continue-on-error: true
    steps:
      # For the strongest guarantee, replace the tag with the full commit SHA it points to.
      - uses: navasvarela/reviewlens@v0.1.0
        # For AI review:
        # with:
        #   ai: "true"
        #   anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

Each PR gets one comment, updated on every push, with the security level, counts, top findings and a link to the report. The link needs a signed-in GitHub account with access to the repository.

A PR from a fork gets a read-only token, so no comment is posted; the same summary appears on the workflow run's summary page.

### GitLab

Include the template in `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
include:
  - remote: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/navasvarela/reviewlens/v0.1.0/ci/gitlab-ci.yml
```

Set `GITLAB_TOKEN` as a masked CI/CD variable: a project access token with the `api` scope. The job needs merge request pipelines. The report link opens in the browser on instances with GitLab Pages enabled; otherwise it downloads as a single HTML file that opens from disk.

### Feedback link

Create a short form in a tool your team already uses, and add its address to `.lens.json` on the default branch. It then appears in the comment and the report:

```json
{ "feedback": { "url": "https://forms.example.com/reviewlens" } }
```

Use your own form rather than this project's public issue tracker, since feedback may describe private code.

## What to measure

| Metric | How | Target (proposal) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Voluntary use | Ask in the weekly form; 👍/👎 reactions on the comment show engagement | Over 60% of pilot reviews by week 2 |
| Time to first review | PR opened to first review, from the host's API | 20% below baseline |
| Time spent on large AI-written PRs | Self-reported per review | 30% below baseline |
| Escaped defects | Bugs traced to pilot PRs within 30 days | No increase |
| Usefulness by section | Weekly form | Over 70% positive, or cut the section |
| Wrong AI statements | Reviewers report them in the form | Under 10% of statements |

Split every metric by AI-generated and hand-written PRs. These are measured by hand or with your own scripts: the tool does not collect any usage data.

## Questions for the weekly form

1. How many reviews did you do this week, and in how many did you open the report?
2. Which parts helped: changed units, file map, change facts, collapsed noise, the Impact tab, the Risks tab, reading order, description check, questions?
3. Which section was wrong or got in the way? Give an example.
4. Did the report change a review decision, or catch something you would have missed?
5. Did you see a false alarm? Which finding, on which PR?
6. If you stopped opening the report, why?

## Before you start

- Read [where the report is hosted and who can open it](../SECURITY.md#the-report-in-ci).
- Try it on a few merged PRs and check that nothing surprising appears in the comment. Comments are visible to everyone who can see the PR.
- Decide on AI review per repository. It sends changed code, plus the PR's title and description, to Anthropic. `"ai": { "allowed": false }` in `.lens.json` forbids it, whatever the job is configured to do.
- Install the security scanners in the CI job if you want them there; a runner without them lists them under "Not checked" in the report. See [Security scanners](../README.md#security-scanners).
- Do the same for the code quality scanners. See [Code quality](../README.md#code-quality). Its findings do not affect the security level, and `"quality": { "enabled": false }` in `.lens.json` turns them off.
- `.lens.json` rules apply once merged: a PR is always judged by the rules on its merge base, and a change to the file is itself a finding.
- The checks that did not run are listed in every report. Tell volunteers that a low security level is not an approval.
