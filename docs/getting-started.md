# Getting started

## Install

You need Node.js 22.18 or newer, pnpm and git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/navasvarela/walkdiff.git
cd walkdiff
pnpm install
```

Run every `pnpm walkdiff` command from this folder.

## Your first report

```bash
pnpm walkdiff review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

Walkdiff fetches the change, analyzes it and prints a local address to open. GitLab works the same way, with a merge request link. Press Ctrl+C when you are done.

The report opens on a brief, with what to check and where to start:

1. **Start the review.** Walkdiff takes you through the changes that matter most, one at a time, and says why each one is there.
2. **Mark what you've reviewed** and leave comments as you go. The side panel shows your progress and links to every change.
3. **Finish.** The last screen shows what you reviewed, what's left, and what Walkdiff couldn't check. In the app, you can post your review from here. Elsewhere, copy your comments.

Everything else is under **All changes**:

- **Changes:** each changed function or type, whole, before and after.
- **Impact:** where other code uses what changed, and which of those callers the PR did not touch.
- **Risks:** the security level, the findings, the checks that ran and the checks that did not. Findings include [breaking changes](../README.md#breaking-changes), which never change the security level.
- **AI review:** a reading order and questions, only if you ask for it with `--ai`.

A low security level means the checks that ran found nothing. It doesn't mean the change is safe, so look at "Not checked" too.

## Private repositories

Walkdiff needs a token that can read the repository. If you use the GitHub CLI:

```bash
GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) pnpm walkdiff review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

For GitLab, create a token with the `read_api` and `read_repository` scopes:

```bash
GITLAB_TOKEN=<token> pnpm walkdiff review https://gitlab.com/group/project/-/merge_requests/123
```

## Keep track of several reviews

```bash
pnpm walkdiff app
```

This opens a list at `http://127.0.0.1:4317/` in your browser. Use `--no-open` to leave your browser alone. Paste a link to add a review. If you're signed in with the GitHub CLI, the app uses that login for GitHub. For GitLab, set `GITLAB_TOKEN` before starting it.

## Post your review

In the app, the finish screen posts your comments and your decision to the PR: Comment, Approve or Request changes. The Conversation tab shows existing threads, where you can reply and resolve them. Nothing is posted until you press the button.

Your token needs write access: `pull-requests: write` on GitHub, or the `api` scope on GitLab. A GitHub CLI login usually already has it.

## Show test evidence

Walkdiff shows whether each change's lines ran in tests when it has a coverage report for the PR's latest commit, in LCOV or Cobertura format. You don't have to set anything up per PR. It looks in this order:

1. **A report you attach.** In the app, choose **Attach coverage** on a review. Pick several files if your repository has one per package. The report updates at once, with no restart and no new analysis, and applies only to that PR. It's dropped when the PR gets new commits.
2. **CI artifacts.** Walkdiff checks the runs for the PR's latest commit: GitHub Actions artifacts or GitLab job artifacts whose name contains `cov`, `lcov` or `cobertura`. A GitHub fine-grained token needs **Actions: read**.
3. **A report the PR adds or updates**, such as one CI commits to a folder. Reports that the PR didn't change are ignored, because they describe an older commit.

Named `lcov.info`, `*.lcov`, `cobertura*.xml` or `coverage*.xml`, reports are found on their own. For other names, add globs to `coverage.paths` in `.walkdiff.json`. On the command line, `--coverage` names a file directly.

A report from CI or the PR is produced by the PR's own code, so treat it as evidence, not proof. Changes whose lines didn't run rank higher.

```bash
pnpm walkdiff review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 --coverage coverage/lcov.info
```

A report you attach or name has to come from the PR's latest commit, or the line numbers won't match. In CI, use the Action's `coverage-file` input or the GitLab template's `WALKDIFF_COVERAGE` variable.

## Security scanners

`pnpm install` also installs Semgrep, gitleaks and osv-scanner, at pinned versions and just for Walkdiff, on macOS and Linux. Semgrep needs Python 3.10 or later. If one can't be installed, the install still finishes, and reports list it as not run.

On other systems, install them yourself and Walkdiff finds them on your `PATH`.
